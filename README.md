### Student: Noah Franck
#### Projects:
### 1. [Dog Converter](dogConverter.s)
#### Goals:
* This is a Program that should prompt the user for weather or not they have a dog.
* If they don't exit program and give a whitty response.
* If they do have a dog ask them how old their dog is & return how old their dog is in dog years folling 1 human year == 7 dog years.
#### Lessons Learned
* How to prompt the user more than one time.
* How to exit a programe safely at any point by terms of an if statement.
### 2. [endgameCalculator](endgameCalculator.s)
#### Assignment:
     Calculator: Endgame AKA Revenge of the Calculator Assignment
     DUE FRIDAY MAY 10, 2019 BEFORE CLASS

    Write a calculator in assembly for the Raspberry Pi.

    It has to be able to take in two operands up to word (32-bit) size and an instruction then perform the requested instruction on the 2 operands.  

    *It MUST support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  (Update: for division, you MUST implement the division by subtraction algorithm discussed in chapter 4 of the book.)

    It MUST support positive and negative 32-bit numbers for the two operands.

    It MUST inform the user if there is an overflow or carry condition after the operation.  You are not required to show the correct result if there is an overflow or carry.  It is better to show an error message and no answer than to show the incorrect answer. (Here's the bonus part: If you can make it show the correct answer to all four operations for all 32-bit positive and negative inputs including carry and overflow conditions, then you get a 1 letter grade bonus onto your final course grade)

    It MUST list any limitations (like maximum input) in the prompts to the user.

    You may collect the inputs from the user however you wish.  You can collect it as one string and then parse it.  You may ask for each operand and the instruction separately.  You may do something else entirely. Your prompts just have to be clear as to what you are expecting the user to do.

    It MUST print out the result to the console.

    The only external functions you may call are gets, puts, printf, and scanf.  All other functions called must be in the code you have written.
#### Lessons Learned
* This was mainly a test of Will and determination.
* Learned that there are times you need to ask others for help.
* That you can program something the long and hard way but that does not mean that it is always the best way to do it.
* How to use C functions in assembly.
* How to work with Github's issues.
### 3. [ROM13](ROM13.s)
#### Assignment:
    Using the toupper code for an assembly reference on using strings, write a program that will take a string from the keyboard and encrypt it using the very weak encryption scheme called "ROT13".

    Details on ROT13 can be found on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)

    Examples of ROT13 encoding are also on that page that you can use to verify your program.

    Submit your souce code file (the .s one) here before class on Monday
#### Lessons Learned:
* How to sort through characters to only select characters in the range that I want.
* How to ecode messages that are equivilant with ROT 13 encoding.
